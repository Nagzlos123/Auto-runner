# Auto-runner
My first unity 3D game
## Description
An endless auto runner game using 3D assets. The player's goal is to get as many golden spheres as possible.

After launching the application, the game starts automatically and our character starts moving.

The character can only move left and right in addition to moving forward (which is out of the player's control). To move to the right, use the "D" or right arrow keys. To move to the left, use the "A" or left arrow keys.
The application also offers the possibility to jump. Use the spacebar to jump.
